## GWAS GAPIT  
Determining what is the favorable allele for your trait based on the + or - effect in GAPIT   
![]()  
For example, you want a lower stripe rust score:  
If you have a - **negative** effect from your GWAS, the **second** allele in your SNP is what is giving the lower rust score  
If you have a + **positive** effect from your GWAS, the **first**  allele in your SNP is what is giving the lower rust score  
The negative or positive value refers to the slope if you were to graph the phenotype in the y axis and 0,1,2 allele in the x-axis ... and what you are determining.. is which allele (0 or 2) to recommend for selection for your favorable allele (the lower rust rating)  
The + and - has nothing to do with major and minor allele.
