### Data Management

[Data organization for Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)

A [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06008-w?utm_source=twt_nr&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=NNPnature) on how we need to be very transarent in our data analysis pipeline. If I ever want to published raw data files, the script to organize and analyze the data, all the way down to producing the final figures, I know from personal experience that I need to be extremely organized, and I am starting [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06008-w?utm_source=twt_nr&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=NNPnature). I have high admiration for scientists that are very transparent, and I dream of getting to the point of publishing a github repo with every raw data file with 'clean' script for the public to follow. So, I'm working on those skills, and these [articles](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) on how to tidy up my script are also a good start.

Furthermore, here is a talk by Karl Broman on [collaborating reproducibly](https://t.co/yYQjWS768e). Feel free to get lost in his blog posts on everything coding, science, and reproducability.

### Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

Great [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05895-3?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf195296490=1) on getting started with an electronic notebook.
A [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1?tm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf201140318=1) about why so many scientists love Jupyter Notebook (I am biased, I know).

*If recently unused, I often forget these coding commands or shortcuts and I have to google search them again. Instead, I just keep my running list of forgotten favorites listed here*

### Git 

*All research files are backed up onto GitHub*
`git pull origin master` : Updates this computers master folder with changes from the other computer
`git status` : Tells you what has changed since the last push
`git add -u` : This tells git to automatically stage tracked files -- including deleting the previously tracked files.
    OR `git add /folder` to add a whole specific folder of changes
`git commit -m 'enter commit comment here'`
`git push origin master`
   *Enter in user name (email) and password*

### Anaconda 

*Use the Anaconda terminal to access Jupyter Notebook*
`cd /d D:`
`cd /d General\ Research\ Files/`
`jupyter notebook` This will start Jupyter Notebook in the web browser
   *Notebooks are found in the `/Lab notebook/` folder*

### Jupyter 

*Shorthand keys*
`Shift-Enter` run cell, select below
`Ctrl-Enter` run cell
`Alt-Enter` run cell, insert below
`M` to markdown (remember to esc from edit mode) `Y` to code

### Markdown 

`Green Text`: Green Text
`Red Text`: Red Text
`Blue Text`: Blue Text
*Colors only work when the md output is html ex: github pages or jupyter notebooks*

`<a id="abbr_name"></a>`: Header link()[#abbr_name]: Reference Header Link&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Tab 6 spaces

`<div style="text-align: right"> [TOC](#TOC) </div>`

`--------------` creates a line break

### Typora 

`Ctrl+/`: Source Code Mode
`Ctrl+Shift+-`: Zoom Out
`Ctrl+Shift+=`: Zoom In

### R 

`colnames(k)<- sub("X","",colnames(k))` replace column name characters like X or V with nothing. This is useful when importing data tables and R formats the empty column names.

`c("#F8766D", "#7CAE00", "#00BFC4","#C77CFF")` : default ggplot2 colors
2
`length(df[!is.na(df)])` Tells me how many values in the df are NOT NA. you can also specify col `df$col`

`CV <- subset(CNLM, GID %in% myCVc$taxa)` Subsetting CNLM with similar GID as myCV taxa, There are 1059 GID in common
`PCC<- merge(myCVc,CV,by="ID")` merge columns by two columns with the same name
`names(myCVc)[14] <- "GID"` rename column 14 only
`PHSred7$GIDx <- with(PHSred7,paste("cuGS",PHSred7$GID,sep=""))` Make dfGID ### to dfGID ### to dfGIDx cuGS### by adding a new row
`PHSwhite$GIDx <- gsub("cuGSOH", "OH", PHSwhite\$GIDx)` replace cuGSOH in column GIDx with OH.

**lme4**
`VarName` : Fixed Effect
`(1|VarName)`: Random Effect; random intercept with fixed mean
`x + (x|VarName)`: Random Effect; correlated intercept and slope with the fixed effect `x`
`(1|Env%in%GID)`: Random effect interaction; GID within Env

**Rounding** [adapted from KBroman](https://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/Rmarkdown.html)
If you want and ouput value of 0.70, and donâ€™t want to see 0.7035597 ... you can use `r round(cor(x,y), 2)` or `r sprintf("%.2f", cor(x,y))` but its, of course, not perfect.
Broman's solution to this problem was to create a function `myround` in my R/broman package `library(broman)`. Now you can write `r myround(cor(x,y), 2)` and it would give 0.70 or -0.001 in the way that you want.
