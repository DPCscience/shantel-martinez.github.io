Shantelâ€™s research career, so far, has been trying to identify genetics contributing the preharvest sprouting tolerance in wheat. Her PhD work was looking at Pacific Northwest wheat germplasm, whereas her post-doctoral studies are looking at Northeast germplasm.

Before we can get knees deep into the genetics of my favorite trait, we need to understand the basic mechanisms of preharvest sprouting.  

Seed dormancy is when a seed in unable to germinate, even under favorable conditions. There are times when we want a seed to germinate, and times when we do not want seeds to germinate, and dormancy helps the latter. A wheat seed reaches its highest level of dormancy at physiological maturity. Dormancy can be lost over a period of time, called after-ripening. Once the whole field of wheat has uniformly matured, farmers go out with a combine to harvest the wheat. The wheat is then sent off to be milled into flour, and bake into your favorite bread, cake, or cookie.   

#### PREHARVEST SPROUTING <a id="PHS"></a>  
If the wheat has already reached maturity and a rain event were to occur before the farmers could harvest/combine the field, the wheat seeds may sprout, causing **preharvest sprouting** (PHS). When seeds sprout, they break down those beautifully long starch chains for energy to begin the germination process. A key enzyme that helps break fown the starch is a-amylase.  And as we can imagine, broken down starch can lead to a very poor quality sized bread, cake, or cookie. Typically when a wheat farm succombs to preharvest sprouting, they either  
**a)** have to sell their grain for feed because it no longer can be used for food (losing food)    
**b)** can only sell the wheat for a reduced price, because the quality is too low for industry standards (losing $$$)

Now as a wheat breeder in an area where it is possible for rain to occur around wheat maturity, we want to tackle this problem head on. There are no common farming applications where a farmer can 'spray' some sort of chemical to prevent PHS from happening, and fields are way too large to cover the crop with a physical barrier (like a tarp) to prevent the rain from reaching the seed. So that leaves us with only one option, growing wheat varieties that are tolerance to PHS genetically.  

In order to find genetic resistance, we need to screen many many types of wheat varieties to determine what is tolerance and what is susceptible.  

#### SCREENING <a id="screen"></a>  
There are two basic ways to screen for PHS: the Falling Number or Spike Wetting test.  

The Falling Numbers (FN) test was created in 1964 by Hagberg and Perten with a primary goal of helping millers and bakers corrrect for a-amylase in their flour. Since the FN test was introduced, it has now become the industry standard to test for wheat flour quality when bakers buy flour from millers, when millers buy flour from grain distributers, and when distributers buy grain from the farmers. In a very basic description of the test, you mix flour with water thoroughly, and record how long it takes a probe (metal bar) to drop through the water-flour solution. So the Falling Number is the time, in seconds, it takes for the probe to fall down the tube. Nifty huh! What this is tell you, is if you have intact starch molecules, your water-flour solution should be thick like gravy, resulting in a long fall time (High FN). Whereas if you have broken starch molecules, your water-flour solution should be thin like water, resulting in a quick fall time (Low FN).

The Spike Wetting test has a primary goal of seeing if the intact wheat spike has the ability to germinate or not when you introduce simulated rain.
