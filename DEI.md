## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

Afternoon fellow crop scientists,    

Recently, I have been asking myself as to whether the racial injustice conversation should be had in the research setting. Below are some answers I have discovered regarding that very question. Some of my words may seem dispassionate and avoid what is going on in our society as a whole right now, but that is with intent. I hope that discussing this topic objectively from an academic perspective can diffuse any tensions we may feel as an individual.   

Even though I'm currently not in the room with you and my lab mates, I hope an electronic message can fill in for a discussion I would like to have face to face on diversity and inclusion in science. This culture of an open discussion in the lab setting was established for me when I was a masters student. My advisor at the time had brought up in lab meeting about how she experiences imposter syndrome even as an experienced PI. That open vulnerable conversation to the entire lab group (not just behind a closed office door) set an example for me that by speaking openly to our peers directly results in inclusivity and education about a topic.   

**The topic I wanted to discuss today is why we should talk about racial injustices, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in academia?**  

**Our social interactions as scientists:** It's easy for me to think I am just a scientist that strictly does science, but I have to remember that my role as a scientist also includes interaction with stakeholders, creating/serving on funding review panels, selecting reviewers as a journal editor, educating youth/undergrads/graduate students, and collaborating globally with other scientists. All of the latter has immense human interaction and I am realizing that when socialization is involved, I need to be aware of how other individuals are treated and how I can best treat a fellow scientist or stakeholder. 

**Thinking beyond our department:** I am also aware it may seem that injustices do not occur in my lab or in my department, but I have to remind myself that we also leave these departments as we navigate our careers. We will leave the lab, we will experience new environments, and we should prepare ourselves and the people we are educating to know how to identify passive or direct racism in the work place along with intentionally increasing diversity and inclusion wherever our jobs take us. 

**Job application requirements:** Finally, the academic job application has changed. For both university and  government agencies, I have experienced interview questions directed at the topic of diversity and inclusion. For faculty positions, more universities are requiring a DEI statement in addition to the research and teaching statement. To become and produce qualified candidates, I need to become educated on diversity and inclusion, build a plan to implement, and change how I used to view what a qualified candidate looked like. This means integrating and giving value to DEI actions within my lab group. 

I am slowly learning and haven't even come close to realizing all the ways we can integrate inclusion into our scientific world. I've added resources I'm learning from and actions I can take within academia listed below. For example, one action I'm tackling right is making sure the reviewers I select as an associate editor is diverse. Being asked to review an article is a opportunity that can help an early career scientist stand out. Opportunities I, as an editor, have the power to disseminate. I am asking myself if the reviewers I select at least represent the diversity I see in the hallways. And honestly, it is hard. However, making intentional actions like this in every aspect of our job is a good place to start. 

I know many of us are being saturated with information right now, so feel free to reach out to me anytime, even as the months go by to talk about more ideas, concerns about addressing the topic, or anything else through slack, text, phone call, email, or even in person when we finally get to see each other again.  

As I am with my science and code, you are always welcome to forward/share this information with other lab mates as well. 


## Actions 
*These actions and resources are a working list and will continue to grow*

- Start a discussion in you office or lab group about what biases and inequalities could be present in academia.    
- Self educate on what experiences individuals have faced in academia so that you are aware of microaggressions, presumed incompetence, disproportionate invisible labor, and racism. This is followed by taking action to reduce exclusivity.    
- When you find an article or workshop about DEI, share them with your peers so they too can attend or read it.   
- Intentionally diversify who you collaborate with.   
- Intentionally diversify who you recommend as reviewers.   
- Intentionally diversify who speaks at departmental seminar.   
- Intentionally diversify the interns, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs who work with you.  
- Give merit to DEI activities done by your students, colleagues, and subordinates as a foundational element of becoming a world class scientist.
