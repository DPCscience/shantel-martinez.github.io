## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

Shantel A. Martinez is currently a USDA-NIFA post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University. She is continuing her research focus of improving wheat preharvest sprouting through genomic selection and QTL mapping. Shantel's career aims are to advance and contribute novel genetic research towards the wheat field of study.

### Broader Impacts
In addition to my work in my academic field, I’ve also developed numerous skills within my position as Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) Director of Professional Development. In one year, I’ve implemented 30 new professional development events, served over 1,800 attendees, coordinated and lead 11 GPSA senators, and sat on both the Professional Development Initiative and GPSA executive board. This role outside of the laboratory has provided me with skills such as communication, collaboration, conflict resolution, leadership, professionalism, and organization.
