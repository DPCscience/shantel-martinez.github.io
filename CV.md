## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

I am currently a [USDA-NIFA](https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&id=anon&pass=&search=R=79175&format=WEBLINK) post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University working in the [Sorrells lab](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/research-extension/small-grains/personnel/). My career focus is on contributing novel genetic research within agriculture using advanced statistical methods while maintaining direct application towards helping farmers. I believe strongly in being able to [communicate](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/outreach.html) science to non-scientists, [mentor](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/mentoring.html) young scientists and peers, along with cultivating a [collaborative work environment](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/Rmd%20Protocols/R%20Protocols.html) as career priorities. 

### EDUCATION
Ph.D., 2018: [Molecular Plant Science](https://mps.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA   
M.S., 2013: [Crop Science](http://css.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA  
B.S., 2011: [Bioengineering](https://voiland.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA    

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
**Wheat Molecular Genetics and Prediction Modeling**    
Post-doctoral | Dr. Mark E. Sorrells Lab &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 - Mar 2020     
 *Cornell University*    
APPLICATION: Producing genomic prediction models on large-scale wheat genomic and phenotypic datasets to reduce grain sprouting when certain climate patterns, such as heavy rainfall during harvest time, increase.    
RESEARCH: Increasing preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance through a genome-wide association study of PHS traits followed by producing genomic prediction models for 1,353 Northeast wheat cultivars and breeding germplasm using 11k genotyping-by-sequencing markers. In tandem, I am fine mapping and characterizing *QPhs.cnl-2B.1* for breeders to directly use for improving preharvest sprouting tolerance.   
SKILLS: Computational genetics, comprehensive R and git version control, genomic prediction using ridge and Bayesian regression models, basic python and bash, electronic lab notebook techniques   

**Improving Germplasm Resources for the PNW**  
PhD | Dr. Camille M. Steber and Dr. Kimberly Garland Campbell Labs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2013 - 2018 
*Washington State University*   
APPLICATION: After the 2016 Low Falling Numbers crisis, wheat farmers needed an immediate solution to ensure their crop would not succumb to the loss of millions of dollars they had just experienced. My research on preharvest sprouting tolerance (PHS) and Falling Numbers was accelerated to meet these demands. After screening 469 PNW wheat breeding lines, I identified 12 new genetic locations that WSU and USDA wheat breeders immediately used to introgress tolerance into their germplasm. Increased grower knowledge on agronomic best practices were also a result of this project.      
RESEARCH: Identified novel loci contributing to wheat PHS tolerance in 469 Northwest germplasm through association mapping of spike-wetting test and falling number traits (Martinez et al., 2018a). Fine mapped an ABA hypersensitive mutant locus that also caused a PHS tolerant phenotype through conducting bulk-segregant exome-capture analysis in a backcross population (*manuscript in preparation*). Produced a drought tolerant mapping population between two Northwest soft white wheat cultivars (Martinez et al., 2018b).   
SKILLS: Comprehensive markdown use, large-scale field data collection and coordination, manuscript preparation, applied plant breeding, quality R data visualization and slide design, mutation genetics  

**Investigating an ABA Hypersensitive Mutant**  
 MS | Dr. Arron H. Carter and Dr. Camille M. Steber  Labs  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011 - 2013  
 *Washington State University*   
APPLICATION: Worked with a molecular geneticist and a wheat breeder to find an applied solution to PHS susceptibility through mutation genetics and field trials. This basic/applied hybrid research experience resulted in learning how to balance an attention-to-detail molecular approach while keeping the large-scale agronomic breeding scope in mind.      
RESEARCH: Characterized the ABA hypersensitive mutant, *Zak ERA8* and wild type endogenous hormone levels within the seed, as well as the germination response in the presence and absence of exogenously applied hormones (Martinez et al., 2016). Segregation analysis, preharvest sprouting trials, agronomic and end-use quality traits were compared between wild type and mutant (Martinez et al., 2014).   
SKILLS: SAS, research-based statistics, hormone seed biology, lab notebook techniques, crop field practices

With this crucial need in mind, the [Professional Development Initiative](https://gradschool.wsu.edu/pdi/) (PDI) was created and in one year we implemented 30 new professional development events, served over 1,800 attendees, coordinated and lead 11 graduate student senators, and sat on both the PDI and GPSA Executive Board.   
<span style="color:#4F94CD">SKILLS</span>: Efficient **peer-to-peer communication**, **interdisciplinary collaboration**, conflict resolution, leadership, professionalism, **strong organization**, built relationships with top-level university leadership
