## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

Shantel A. Martinez is currently a USDA-NIFA [post-doctorate fellow](https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&id=anon&pass=&search=R=79175&format=WEBLINK) at Cornell University working in the [Sorrells lab](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/research-extension/small-grains/personnel/). She is continuing her research focus of improving wheat preharvest sprouting through genomic selection and QTL mapping. Shantel's career aims are to discover and contribute novel genetic research within the wheat genome using advanced statistical methods.   

### EDUCATION
Ph.D., 2018: Molecular Plant Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA   
M.S., 2013: Crop Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA  
B.S., 2011: Bioengineering, Washington State University, Pullman WA  

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
**Wheat Molecular Genetics in Preharvest Sprouting**    
Dr. Mark E. Sorrells Lab  
*May 2018 - Present* | *Cornell University*    
Increasing preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance through genome-wide association study of PHS traits followed by producing genomic selection models for Northeast wheat germplasm. In tandem, characterization of a dormant QTL will be done through endogenous seed hormone profiling. The end goal is to fine map the dormant QTL and confirm a candidate dormancy gene(s). Skills in computational genetics, comprehensive markdown and git use, tissue regeneration, and LCMS biochemistry are being obtained.   

**Improving Germplasm Resources for the PNW**  
Dr. Camille M. Steber  and Dr. Kimberly Garland Campbell Labs  
*2013 - 2018* | *Washington State University*   
Identify novel loci contributing to PHS and drought tolerance in wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) with an emphasis on the role of the plant hormone ABA (abscisic acid) in controlling these processes. This was done by identify loci providing PHS tolerance in northwest germplasm through association mapping of spike-wetting tests and falling number traits (Martinez et al., 2018a). I also mapped an ABA hypersensitive mutant, *ERA8*, locus that also causes a PHS tolerance phenotype through conducting linkage analysis in a RIL population along with bulk segregation analysis to fine map *ERA8* in a backcross population with wild-type (*manuscript in preparation*). And finally, I produced a drought tolerant mapping population between two PNW soft white spring wheat cultivars (Martinez et al., 2018b). Skills in comprehensive R use, large-scale field experiment coordination, manuscript preparation, KASP marker system, and mutation genetics were also acquired.    

**Investigating an ABA Hypersensitive Mutant**  
 Dr. Camille M. Steber and Dr. Arron H. Carter Labs   
*2011 - 2013* | *Washington State University*   
During this project I studied the characteristics of an ABA hypersensitive mutant, *Zak ERA8*. Wild-type and mutant endogenous hormone levels within the seed were compared as well as the germination response in the presence and absence of exogenously applied hormones ABA and GA (Martinez et al., 2016). Segregation analysis, preharvest sprouting trials, agronomic and end-use quality traits were also compared between wild type and mutant (Martinez et al., 2014). Skills were refined in SAS and hormone seed biology.
