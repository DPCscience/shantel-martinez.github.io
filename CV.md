## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

Shantel A. Martinez is currently a USDA-NIFA post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University working in the [Sorrells lab](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/research-extension/small-grains/personnel/). She is continuing her research focus of improving wheat preharvest sprouting through genomic selection and QTL mapping. Shantel's career aims are to advance and contribute novel genetic research towards the wheat field of study.    

### EDUCATION
Ph.D., 2018: Molecular Plant Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA   
M.S., 2013: Crop Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA  
B.S., 2011: Bioengineering, Washington State University, Pullman WA  

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
**Wheat Molecular Genetics in Preharvest Sprouting**    
Dr. Mark E. Sorrells Lab  
*May 2018 - Present* | *Cornell University*    
Increasing preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance through genome-wide association study of PHS traits followed by producing genomic selection models for Northeast wheat germplasm. In tandem, characterization of a dormant QTL will be done through endogenous seed hormone profiling. The end goal is to fine map the dormant QTL and confirm a candidate dormancy gene(s). Skills in computational genetics, comprehensive markdown and git use, tissue regeneration, and LCMS biochemistry are being obtained.   

**Improving Germplasm Resources for the PNW**  
Dr. Camille M. Steber  and Dr. Kimberly Garland Campbell Labs  
*2013 - 2018* | *Washington State University*   
Identify novel loci contributing to PHS and drought tolerance in wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) with an emphasis on the role of the plant hormone ABA (abscisic acid) in controlling these processes. This was done by identify loci providing PHS tolerance in northwest germplasm through association mapping of spike-wetting tests and falling number traits (Martinez et al., 2018a). I also mapped an ABA hypersensitive mutant, *ERA8*, locus that also causes a PHS tolerance phenotype through conducting linkage analysis in a RIL population along with bulk segregation analysis to fine map *ERA8* in a backcross population with wild-type (*manuscript in preparation*). And finally, I produced a drought tolerant mapping population between two PNW soft white spring wheat cultivars (Martinez et al., 2018b). Skills in comprehensive R use, large-scale field experiment coordination, manuscript preparation, KASP marker system, and mutation genetics were also acquired.    

**Investigating an ABA Hypersensitive Mutant**  
 Dr. Camille M. Steber and Dr. Arron H. Carter Labs   
*2011 - 2013* | *Washington State University*   
During this project I studied the characteristics of an ABA hypersensitive mutant, *Zak ERA8*. Wild-type and mutant endogenous hormone levels within the seed were compared as well as the germination response in the presence and absence of exogenously applied hormones ABA and GA (Martinez et al., 2016). Segregation analysis, preharvest sprouting trials, agronomic and end-use quality traits were also compared between wild type and mutant (Martinez et al., 2014). Skills were refined in SAS and hormone seed biology.

### PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
**Future Professors Institute** 2018  
The focus of the series I attended was: Advancing Diversity in Academia. Skillsets were introduced which include understanding what the search committee is looking for, career plans, research plans, publication plans, negotiating a contract, and starting up your first lab.            
**Director of Professional Development** 2016-2017   
In addition to my work in the academic field, I’ve also developed numerous skills within my position as Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) Director of Professional Development. In one year, I’ve implemented 30 new professional development events, served over 1,800 attendees, coordinated and lead 11 GPSA senators, and sat on both the Professional Development Initiative and GPSA Executive Board. This role outside of the laboratory has provided me with exceptional soft skills such as communication, collaboration, conflict resolution, leadership, professionalism, and organization.
