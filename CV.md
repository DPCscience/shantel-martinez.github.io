## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

Shantel A. Martinez is currently a USDA-NIFA post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University. She is continuing her research focus of improving wheat preharvest sprouting through genomic selection and QTL mapping. Shantel's career aims are to advance and contribute novel genetic research towards the wheat field of study.
