## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  

Shantel A. Martinez is currently a [USDA-NIFA](https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&id=anon&pass=&search=R=79175&format=WEBLINK) post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University working in the [Sorrells lab](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/research-extension/small-grains/personnel/). My career focuses on contributing novel genetic research within agriculture using advanced statistical methods while maintaining direct application towards helping farmers.  I strongly believe in being able to [communicate](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/outreach.html) science to non-scientists, [mentoring](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/mentoring.html) young scientists and peers, along with cultivating a [collaborative work environment](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/Rmd%20Protocols/R%20Protocols.html) as career priorities.      

### EDUCATION
Ph.D., 2018: [Molecular Plant Science](https://mps.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA   
M.S., 2013: [Crop Science](http://css.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA  
B.S., 2011: [Bioengineering](https://voiland.wsu.edu/), Washington State University, Pullman WA    

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
**Wheat Molecular Genetics in Preharvest Sprouting**    
Dr. Mark E. Sorrells Lab  
*May 2018 - Present* | *Cornell University*    
RESEARCH: Increasing preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance through a genome-wide association study of PHS traits followed by producing genomic prediction models for 1,353 Northeast wheat cultivars and breeding germplasm using 11k genotyping-by-sequencing markers. In tandem, I am characterizing a PHS tolerant QTL through endogenous seed hormone profiling. The end goal is to fine map the dormant QTL and confirm a candidate dormancy gene for breeders to directly use for improving preharvest sprouting tolerance.   
SKILLS: Computational genetics, comprehensive R and git version control, genomic prediction using ridge and Bayesian regression models, basic python and bash, electronic lab notebook techniques   

**Improving Germplasm Resources for the PNW**  
Dr. Camille M. Steber  and Dr. Kimberly Garland Campbell Labs  
*2013 - 2018* | *Washington State University*   
RESEARCH: Identified novel loci contributing to wheat PHS tolerance in 469 Northwest germplasm through association mapping of spike-wetting test and falling number traits (Martinez et al., 2018a). Fine mapped an ABA hypersensitive mutant locus that also caused a PHS tolerant phenotype through conducting bulk-segregant exome-capture analysis in a backcross population (*manuscript in preparation*). Produced a drought tolerant mapping population between two Northwest soft white wheat cultivars (Martinez et al., 2018b).   
SKILLS: Comprehensive markdown use, large-scale field data collection and coordination, manuscript preparation, applied plant breeding, quality R data visualization and slide design, mutation genetics  

**Investigating an ABA Hypersensitive Mutant**  
 Dr. Camille M. Steber and Dr. Arron H. Carter Labs   
*2011 - 2013* | *Washington State University*   
RESEARCH: Characterized the ABA hypersensitive mutant, *Zak ERA8* and wild type endogenous hormone levels within the seed, as well as the germination response in the presence and absence of exogenously applied hormones (Martinez et al., 2016). Segregation analysis, preharvest sprouting trials, agronomic and end-use quality traits were compared between wild type and mutant (Martinez et al., 2014).   
SKILLS: SAS, research-based statistics, hormone seed biology, lab notebook techniques, crop field practices

**Director of Professional Development** 2016-2017   
During my PhD, a handful of graduate students and I noticed a need for opportunities to develop professional skills across all disciplines that just weren't being met within graduate programs. With this crucial need in mind, the [Professional Development Initiative](https://gradschool.wsu.edu/pdi/) (PDI) was created and I spent a year as the Director of Professional Development for the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA). Implemented 30 new professional development events, served over 1,800 attendees, coordinated and lead 11 graduate student senators, and sat on both the PDI and GPSA Executive Board.   
SKILLS: <u>Efficient peer-to-peer communication</u>, <u>interdisciplinary collaboration</u>, conflict resolution, leadership, professionalism, <u>strong organization</u>, built relationships with university leadership (President and Deans)
