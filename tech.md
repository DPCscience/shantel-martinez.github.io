## Cool Techy Resources I Must Share  

#### Professional Website 
First off, you may think I am this highly experienced HTML coder that can make her own website, but I am not. I am just extremely good at Googling how to do things, thats my #1 talent for any talent show. 
So here are some helpful links that got me started:  
- First and foremost, I started out familiar with the basics of [git and github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E). I used the resources in github for my infrastructor of the webpage. Most people talk about git as a way to version control collaborative work, but it is so much more than just keeping track of versions of code (this website is an example!). Learning the basics of git is very helpful in general if you go anywhere near the big data research world.       
- Next, I stumbled across this ladies [professional website](http://sarahcarey.github.io) one day, and since I noticed it was hosted by git (which is very open source oriented), I knew I could look at her basic code to figure out how to do it myself (but here is an example of [mine](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/shantel-martinez.github.io/blob/master/index.md) , click the RAW button to view the script).         
- I also found this [github help site](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to explain the basics of the github.io webpage system  
- And finally, I used my markdown coding skills to write it all up. See my favorite markdown links below.     




#### Data Management  
[Data organization for Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)  
An [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06008-w?utm_source=twt_nr&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=NNPnature) on how we need to be very transarent in our data analysis pipeline. I know from personal experience that I need to be extremely organized if I ever want to published raw data files, the script to organize and analyze the data, down to producing the final figure. I have high admiration for scientists that are very transparent, and dream of getting to the point of publishing a github repo with every data file and 'clean' script for the public to follow. So, I am working on those skills, and these articles [1](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) [2]() on how to tidy up my script was a good start.   
Also, here is a talk by Karl Broman on [Collaborating reproducibly](https://t.co/yYQjWS768e). Feel free to get lost in his blog posts on everything coding, science, and reproducability. 

#### Markdown  
'Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax' - Wikepedia   
So basically, its a way to write text that so many programs like reddit, github, r studio, jupyter notebooks, etc use in one way or another.    

Simple [cheat sheets for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) that I am constantly going back to (my brain can only hold so much... so I may or may not remember how to embed youtube videos if I rarely use that command).  
For PC folks, I really like using [Typora](https://typora.io/) as program to use when I need to scribble quick notes in markdown on my desktop. Its simple, clean, and auto-publishes from markdown script to the final form. Typora is also available for MAC users, which I also use often, but I havent looked into whether or not there is a better competitor out ther.   

#### Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)  

Great [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05895-3?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf195296490=1) on getting started with an electronic notebook.   
A [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1?tm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf201140318=1) about why so many scientists love Jupyter Notebook.
