### Research Progress   

As a part of a public government agency, USDA NIFA requires funding fellows to create 'a dissemination plan describing the methods that will be used to communicate findings and project accomplishments.' This page, along with NIFA REEPort updates, scientific conference preceedings, and publication of research projects in peer-reviewed journals, will act as my method of disseminating research objectives and goals.   
Knowledge sharing and transparency are also skills I wish to cultivate and maintain as I grow as a scientist.
