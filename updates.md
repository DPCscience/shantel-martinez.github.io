### Research Progress   

As a part of a public government agency, USDA NIFA requires funding fellows to create 'a dissemination plan describing the methods that will be used to communicate findings and project accomplishments.' This page, along with NIFA REEPort updates, scientific conference preceedings, and publication of research projects in peer-reviewed journals, will act as my method of disseminating research objectives and goals.   
Knowledge sharing and transparency are also skills I wish to cultivate and maintain as I grow as a scientist.

**Advance the basic understanding of important preharvest sprouting wheat genes and use this information to enhance genetic gain in wheat breeding programs**  
Objective 1. Attempt to confirm the candidate gene(s) of interest by knocking out the dormancy allele in PHS tolerant gene (QPhs.cnl-2B.1) found in Cayuga  
Objective 2. Study the endogenous hormone levels on a wheat isoline with and without the Cayuga 2B dormancy gene over multiple after-ripening time points  
Objective 3. Develop and use a genomic selection model for preharvest sprouting tolerance in Northeast wheat   

A detailed review of the overall objectives can be found [here](https://shantel-martinez.github.io/objectives.html)
