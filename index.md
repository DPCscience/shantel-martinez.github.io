**Wheat podcast episodes to get lost in:**
Wheat All About It: Falling Numbers, Rising Optimism [Episode 73](http://wagrains.org/podcast/episode-73-falling-numbers-rising-optimism/)   
> Crisis hit the PNW in 2016, and thanks to the hard work of the grain commission and many others, we can now devote more money, time and resources to tacking low FNs. Listen to the more policital side of funding that, I as a researcher often forget, is extremely crucial. 
> Find all of the episodes online or on itunes [here](http://wagrains.org/cast/)  

Eat This : Our Daily Bread 14 [The daily grind](www.eatthispodcast.com/our-daily-bread-14/)  
> In Aug this year food podcaster, Jeremy Cherfas, gave us an episode everyday on little topics about bread.   
> In episode 14, its was fascinating to hear about how many hours **every day** a member of the houshold would hand-mill wheat just for that days worth of food (*made me SUPER grateful for large scale mills.. wheww*)  
> Give it a listen, and if you like it, check out the rest of the [episodes](https://www.eatthispodcast.com/bread/)

## S Martinez CV 
## Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Breeding and Genetics  
Shantel A. Martinez is currently a USDA-NIFA post-doctorate fellow at Cornell University. She is continuing her research focus of improving wheat preharvest sprouting through genomic selection and QTL mapping. Shantel's career aims are to advance and contribute novel genetic research towards the wheat field of study.    

### Education 
Ph.D., 2018: Molecular Plant Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA   
M.S., 2013: Crop Science, Washington State University, Pullman WA  
B.S., 2011: Bioengineering, Washington State University, Pullman WA  

### Research  
*May 2018 - Present*  
*Cornell University*  
Increasing preharvest sprouting tolerance in Northeast wheat through:   
> GWAS of PHS traits  
> Genomic selection modeling of PHS traits  
> Endogenous seed hormone profiling  
> Fine mapping dormancy gene(s) & Confirming candidate dormancy genes
