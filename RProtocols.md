## R Protocols     
Tricks of the trade. A compilation of topics I found to be useful while coding in R. Thought I would share them with you all.    

### Plant Breeding & Genetics  
[Heritability](./Rmd Protocols/Heritability.html) Are we still talking about how to calculate heritability? Yes... yes we are. It's been a topic in our office for what feels like a month, so I wrote up a small summary & how to calculate H2 in R   

[QTL Analysis](http://rpubs.com/shantel-martinez/ERA8-Mapping) I recently published an article that included QTL analysis; follow the entire workflow from data to the published figures.     

[GWAS in GAPIT](./Rmd Protocols/GAPITAllele.html) Determining what is the "favorable" allele for your trait based on the + or - effect in GAPIT    

[Genomic Prediction](./Rmd Protocols/GenomicPrediction.html) The most recent topic I am learning, so you can see my work in progress, as I learn too.      

### Data Visualization   
#### Want some figure inspiration for your R plots?   
[#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=tyah) hashtag on Twitter. TidyTuesday has people coding on the same topic every week. You can see how different graphics can be made from the same dataset, and often people share the scripts that created the graph. Engaging in tidytuesday expands my creativity and improves my technical skills. Here is an example of a #TidyTuesday I did for [Week 20](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shantel-martinez/shantel-martinez.github.io/blob/master/Rmd%20Protocols/TidyTuesdayWk20.html)  

[tidyverse](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidyverse&src=tyah) and [dataviz](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dataviz&src=typd) are two other hashtags on twitter I keep and eye on.. in addition to following [Dr. Cédric Scherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer), his data viz shares are always inspiring.     

[Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) - Join the society and their slack workspace. They have critique, inspirational, and showcase channels that I obsessively read and see how others create stories from data.

[Nightingale](https://medium.com/nightingale) has really good general data viz blog posts.  

#### Favorite blog posts     
[What to consider when creating tables](https://blog.datawrapper.de/guide-what-to-consider-when-creating-tables/) Dos & don’ts of table design  
[What to consider when choosing colors for data visualization](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors/) a ton of 'not ideal' and 'better' graphic comparisons.     

### Resources  
[Computing Resources](./Rmd Protocols/CodingShortcuts.html) includes topics such as electronic notebooks, coding shortcuts and links to cheatsheets.      

#### Data Management:  
[No more excuses for non-reproducible methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06008-w?utm_source=twt_nr&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=NNPnature). If I ever want to published raw data files, the script to organize and analyze the data, all the way down to producing the final figures, I know from personal experience that I need to be extremely organized, and this article is a good start. I have high admiration for scientists that are very transparent, and I dream of getting to the point of publishing a github repo with every raw data file with 'clean' script for the public to follow.  

Also... can we really avoid Excel, GoogleSheets, and csv files? No. But we can make our life easier downstream with these tips:

#### Tips on how to improve your R code:     
This is where I started. But most of the new tricks I learn is reading stackoverflow posts when I am trying to find a coding solution, and also twitters #Rstat and #tidytuesday hashtags give me a lot of articles on how to tidy code up or run things a different way.

[Collaborating reproducibly](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/rrcollab.pdf) is a talk by Karl Broman
