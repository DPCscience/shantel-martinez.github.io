## Current Projects  
### Genomic Prediction for PHS Tolerance   
![](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/Lab_Resources/blob/master/example_img/GS_PC.PNG?raw=true)   
[Question] Looking specifically at Northeast wheat varieties, can we develop a model to predict if a wheat variety will be PHS tolerant or susceptible based on the genetics of each?  

[Why] Breeders can make better decisions on wheat that have PHS tolerance when releasing a line to farmers.    

----------
### Fine-Map and Confirm a Candidate Dormancy Gene(s)    
![](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/Lab_Resources/blob/master/example_img/MappingCayuga.PNG?raw=true)  
[Question] What gene(s) influence PHS tolerance that the breeders and farmers see in the soft white wheat, Cayuga?  

[Why] If a perfect marker is created, breeders can use this wheat variety + the marker to introgress this PHS tolerant gene into their favorite wheat (that may happen to grow well in their region, but is PHS susceptible).    

----------
### Endogenous Hormone Levels of Dormant Wheat  
![](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/Lab_Resources/blob/master/example_img/Hormone_TugofWar.PNG?raw=true)   
[Question] Are there differences in natural plant hormone levels inside the wheat seed that have a dormancy gene compared to others that do not?   

[Why] To better understand the 2B dormancy gene and how it is changing Cayuga to make it PHS tolerant.

## USDA NIFA Fellowship Project Outline

### TO GERMINATE, OR NOT TO GERMINATE: IMPROVING PREHARVEST SPROUTING TOLERANCE IN WHEAT  
PROPOSAL NO: [2017-07109](https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&id=anon&pass=&search=R=79175&format=WEBLINK)

### Non-Technical Summary  
Preharvest sprouting (PHS), the germination of seed on the mother plant under cool and wet conditions, is a reoccurring problem for wheat farmers worldwide. PHS susceptibility can lead to degradation of starch granules which results in poor quality bread and cakes. PHS susceptibility is associated with lower seed dormancy. Seed dormancy is regulated by plant hormones such as Abscisic acid (ABA) which stimulates seed dormancy, whereas gibberellins (GAs) stimulate seed germination. This post-doctoral research projects' goal is to establish a competitive independent research program that expands the knowledge of PHS tolerance with an applicable approach that will directly benefit the Nation's wheat industry. Objective 1 proposes to resolve candidate genes through fine mapping and confirm the PHS tolerant gene found in a northwest cultivar, Cayuga. Objective 2 will characterize the Cayuga dormancy gene through seed hormone profiling of ABA, GA, and GA precursors along. Objective 3 will evaluate a panel of 1,128 white winter wheat cultivars and elite breeding lines for PHS tolerant loci using genome-wide association mapping and genomic selection. Novel loci accompanied by an accurate Cayuga dormancy locus identified in this study can improve PHS tolerance in any breeding program through marker assisted selection.  

### Goals / Objectives  
**Advance the basic understanding of important preharvest sprouting wheat genes and use this information to enhance genetic gain in wheat breeding programs**  
Objective 1. Attempt to confirm the candidate gene(s) of interest by knocking out the dormancy allele in PHS tolerant gene (QPhs.cnl-2B.1) found in Cayuga  
Objective 2. Study the endogenous hormone levels on a wheat isoline with and without the Cayuga 2B dormancy gene over multiple after-ripening time points  
Objective 3. Develop and use a genomic selection model for preharvest sprouting tolerance in Northeast wheat   
This project significantly expands on the understanding of wheat seed dormancy by combining hormone profiling, gene expression, and gene validation.
